## 🎯 Active Objective: Assignment 1

**Goal:** Evaluate a new dataset in the analytical environment  
You will:
- Load and inspect the Titanic dataset
- Classify variables (quantitative vs qualitative)
- Recategorize any misclassified variables
- Apply Stevens' typologies (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)
- Understand variable types' impact on analysis

📍 All work is performed in:  
`assignment-01/assignment-01.Rmd`

## 🧠 Dataset

**Titanic (Kaggle):**  
- `train.csv` is stored in `data/raw/`
- 891 observations × 12 variables  
- Used to practice structural inspection, classification, and EDA foundations

---

## 🧰 Tools

- R / RStudio  
- R Markdown  
- Git + GitHub  
- Core R packages: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `Amelia`
